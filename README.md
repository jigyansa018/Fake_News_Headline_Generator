# Fake_News_Headline_Generator
This is a fun Python project called Fake News Headline Generator 📰😂. It randomly creates hilarious fake news headlines using a combination of subjects, actions, and places. Whether it's "Rohit Sharma dances with aliens at Puri Sea Beach", the results are unpredictable and entertaining! 😆


A fun and quirky Python script that generates **random fake news headlines** for laughs! 🎉 Built using basic Python concepts like `random`, `lists`, and `while` loops.

## 🤖 How It Works
The script randomly picks:
- A **subject** (e.g., "Rohit Sharma")
- An **action** (e.g., "dances with aliens")
- A **place/event** (e.g., "at Puri Sea Beach")

Then it combines them into a **BREAKING NEWS** headline! 🧠💥
